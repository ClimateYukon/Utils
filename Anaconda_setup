# How to install python 2.7 with all the requirements to run ALFRESCO post processing package :

#download the last anaconda package for the last python 3 :
#miniconda is more appropriate for ALFRESCO post processing as it just ships with the basic packages
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh

#install the python 3 version of Anaconda, there is still possibility to set up py27 environment easily after that
#Answer Yes to every questions, it will create a base repository name anaconda3
bash Anaconda3-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh 

#Refresh the bashrc so conda command are recognized
source ~/.bashrc 

#Create a new virtualenvironment through conda just asking it to install ipython for debugging
conda create --name ALFPP27 python=2.7 ipython

#to activate it :
source activate ALFPP27

#install the Alfresco Post processing package (see package github for this step)
pip install git+git://github.com/ua-snap/alfresco_postprocessing.git










#Keep that in case the setup.py from alfpp is missing some package :
#conda create --name ALFPP27 python=2.7 --file /workspace/Shared/Users/jschroder/Github/Utils/ALF.txt
